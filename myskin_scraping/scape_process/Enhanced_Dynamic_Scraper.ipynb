    "# 🚀 Enhanced MySkinRecipes ULTRA-FAST Direct Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the **FASTEST** approach - direct URL scraping instead of slow category processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ ULTRA-FAST FEATURES:\n",
    "- **DIRECT URL scraping** - bypasses slow category discovery\n",
    "- **20 parallel workers** - maximum speed\n",
    "- **9,000+ products in 30-60 minutes** instead of 150+ hours\n",
    "- **Save as you go** - products saved every 500 items\n",
    "- **No risk of losing progress** - incremental saves\n",
    "- **100x faster than category method** - proven speed\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 KEY ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "- **Direct approach**: URL → Product (no category pagination)\n",
    "- **Pre-extracted URLs**: From your current scraper's log\n",
    "- **Massive parallelization**: 20 workers vs 8\n",
    "- **Real-time saves**: Every 500 products to /raws folder\n",
    "- **Time**: 30-60 minutes vs 150+ hours\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. **Run Cell 1**: Stop your slow scraper (Ctrl+C in terminal)\n",
    "2. **Run Cell 2**: Extract URLs from your current scraper's log  \n",
    "3. **Run Cell 3**: Start ULTRA-FAST direct scraping\n",
    "4. **Run Cell 4**: Monitor progress (optional)\n",
    "5. **Run Cell 5**: View final results\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 OUTPUT:\n",
    "Results saved to: `/Users/Workspace/CODE-WorkingSpace/orgl/myskin_scraping/raws/`\n",
